# Ordered Numbers Interaction

The Ordered Numbers Interaction is a mini game that was developed for my Master Thesis "Developing a Support Infrastructure for an Escape The Room and Peddy Paper Games".

This mini game, or interaction as I so call it, was developed to be part of an Escape the Room game that was also developed as part of my thesis. Since this interaction can work as a standalone mini game I decided to place it here for anyone interested in using it.

## List of Components

In order to fully assemble the Interaction, so as to look like the picture below, you will also need to 3D Print the enclosure which is divided into two parts that can be found [here](enclosure/). Additionally, you will also need to 3D Print the keycaps which **were not** designed by me but can be found in [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2783650).
